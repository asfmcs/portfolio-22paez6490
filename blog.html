<h3 id="html">What I've learned of html</h3>
<p>There are many things that I've learned this year in Computer Honors, one of those things is <strong>html</strong>. I leanred many things about html, for example that it is what creates websites and it's what I'm using right now to write this blog.<br>
HTML has taught to create website but also to be patient. You need to be patient when using HTML because it's a lot a codes and things you need to remember, for example just to write this paragraph I need to add a specific feature.</p>
<h3 id="css">What I've learned from CSS</h3>
<p>This year, not only have I been learning about HTML, but I've also been learning about <strong>CSS</strong>. CSS is the style part of HTML, this is what helps change colors, sizes and many other things.<br>
I've learned a lot of things about CSS, for example how to change the background color, the text color, font size and many other things. It's been fun learning about CSS and experimening what I can do.</p>
